**CHALLENGE**

1. _Add an icon to the “Everyone” screen showing whether a prospect was contacted or not._
1. _Add an editing screen, so users can adjust the name and email address of someone they scanned previously. (Tip: Use the simple form of NavigationLink rather than navigationDestination(), to avoid your list selection code confusing the navigation link.)_
1. _All users to customize the way contacted are sorted – by name or by most recent._
